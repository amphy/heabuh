	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<hr></hr>
	<p>
	Hi, I'm Heather, and I like to make things.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am currently a sophomore at the University of Georgia studying Chemistry and Computer Science. My interests lie in the intersection between medicine and technology as well as ways technology can make life easier for others. I've been involved in technology related endeavors since the third grade, but it was only in college that I finally began to pursue coding as a true career path. I hope to continue developing as both a person and a developer over the next few years!
